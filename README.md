# luckygame-rs
**luckygame-rs** is a complete rewrite of the [luckygame-v2](https://github.com/shayanshokry/luckygame-v2) project, a simple luck-based game written in Rust.  
You start with three chances to open mystery boxes. 
Each box contains a specific number of points.  
Use these points to buy extra chances and keep playing.
